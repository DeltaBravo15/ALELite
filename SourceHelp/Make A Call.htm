<hr>
The overall point to this software is to allow the user to place a call to another station and exchange messages. This is the option to do that.
<p>
Before a call can be placed, however, you need to <a href="Open Configure.htm">open</a> an existing configuration file or <a href="Edit Configure.htm">create</a> one so that the program has a valid Self Address and a list of Other Addresses to which you can place a call.
<p>
To begin sounding, pull down the "Transmit" menu from the toolbar and select one of the following,
<p><ul>
<li><a href="Allcall.htm">Allcall
<li><a href="Individual Call.htm">Individual Call
<li><a href="AMD Message.htm">AMD Message
</ul>
