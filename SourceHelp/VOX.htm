In the <a href="wiring.htm">wiring</a> diagram, a VOX is shown. This is a Voice-Activated Switch (VOX). The VOX circuit will react to a voice-frequency signal on the output line from the sound card and trigger the Push-To-Transmit (PTT) circuit in the radio. Use of this switch means that the transmitter is only on when a signal is actually being transmitted.

<p>A kit to build a VOX can be ordered from <a href="http://www.rainbowkits.com">Rainbow Kits</a>, among others.
