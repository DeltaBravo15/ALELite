AMD Messages that are received during the current session are automatically displayed on a pop-up screen when they are received. The messages can be redisplayed by selecting the "View" drop-down menu and then selecting "AMD Messages".
<p>
AMD Messages are not saved between sessions. To save a message, block and copy it, paste it into a program such as Notepad, and then save it to disk.
