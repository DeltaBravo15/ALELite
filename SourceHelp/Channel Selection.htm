Changing Channels
</font></h3></center>
<hr>
Since you will often be specifying <a href="What Use ALE.htm">different destination stations</a> and frequencies, you will need to create a list of often-used channels.
<p>
Before you begin transmitting or receiving messages, you will need to <a href="Add Channel.htm">add</a> at least one channel to the channel list.
<p>
A channel is a pair of frequencies (one on which to transmit and one on which to receive) that establish a complete circuit for exchanging messages with another station. Each frequency in the pair will have its own attributes. In most cases, the transmit and receive frequencies will be the same.
<p>
Once channels have been added, you can <a href="Edit Channel.htm">edit or delete</a> the channels.
